This project is a small collection of convenience and utility classes, mostly used by other FreeLibrary projects. It includes utilities related to I18N, I/O, ResourceBundles, String manipulation, XQuery, ClassLoaders, and Pairtree file systems.

There is not a lot of documentation at this point. Hopefully, in the near future, there will be some documentation about each of the packages listed above.
