		<p>This BZip2 package comes from the Ant BZip2 package (which is based on the work of Keiron
			Liddle, Aftex Software). The BZip2 classes were extracted from the Ant project and made
			available as a separate package by <a href="http://www.kohsuke.org/bzip2/">Kohsuke
				Kawaguchi</a>. The FreeLibrary project then took these separate BZip2 classes and put them
			in the <code>info.freelibrary</code> package. They are licensed under the APL 2.0 license.</p>
