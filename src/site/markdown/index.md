### Introduction

This project is a small collection of convenience and utility classes, mostly used by other FreeLibrary projects. It includes utilities related to: string manipulation, IO, XQuery, ResourceBundles, ClassLoaders, I18N, and Pairtree file systems.

### Getting Started

Using it is pretty simple.  Just include it in your project's pom.xml file as a dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>info.freelibrary</groupId>
      <artifactId>freelib-utils</artifactId>
      <version>0.3.0</version>
    </dependency>
    
You can check out the project's [Javadocs](apidocs/index.html "FreeLib-Utils' Javadocs") to see how to use particular classes.
