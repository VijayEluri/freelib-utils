# FreeLibrary Utilities [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ksclarke/freelib-utils.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ksclarke/freelib-utils)

This project is a small collection of convenience and utility classes (mostly used by other FreeLibrary projects). It includes utilities related to I/O, ResourceBundles, String manipulation, XQuery, ClassLoaders, Maven builds, and Pairtree file systems.

To build it, you will need a modern JDK and at least Maven version 3.2.2. Once you have those installed, you can check the project out from GitHub and build it with the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-utils.git
    cd freelib-utils
    mvn install

If you want to use a pre-built version, please consult the project's [home page](http://projects.freelibrary.info/freelib-utils) to learn more.
