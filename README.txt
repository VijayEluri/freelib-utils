FreeLib Utilities (version 0.2.3)
===============================================================================

FreeLib Utilities is just a small collection of convenience classes used by
  other FreeLibrary projects.

Development is taking place on github (http://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-utils),
  mostly so I can learn git.
